Superstore Yearly Sales Analysis
==================================================================================
This analysis aims to understand sales trends over time in order to uncover key patterns 
and insights. This includes identifying the primary drivers of growth each year, 
pinpointing which segments and categories are experiencing growth or stagnation, 
and determining if there are seasonalpatterns that can be leveraged for 
strategic advantage.
    
Structure:
    - Yearly trends: high-level growth and contribution by Segment + Category
    - Monthly trends: seasonality by Segment
